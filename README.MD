My Portfolio Project
The reason for this project is to prepare myself and to be ready with a portfolio so i can use for my career. 
Portfolios are purposeful collection of student work that exhibits the student's efforts, progress, and achievements, 
further along the bootcamp, I will continue to add and make changes along the way.
I learned more coding and different tricks for both html and css. 
Here is a GIF screen recording of my portfolio:
